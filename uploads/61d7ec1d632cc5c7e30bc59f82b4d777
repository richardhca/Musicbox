1. Which model did the best for the colour-prediction task? Can you give a theory about why?

The SVC Classifier with linear kernel did better with rgb color space. The colors are overlapping and there is no clear linear
border anywhere.

2. Have a look at the cities in your test data where the weather model makes the wrong prediction.
Do you feel like the model is making reasonable mistakes? Can you think of any weather features
that we could potentially add to make better predictions?

Some parameter values are relatively close to each other and provide no distinction between cities. The Model makes reasonable mistakes
because there is no other weather feature to rely on and is at least better than human perception.
There needs to be many more weather features to create more distinction. Temperature at a specific times of the day would
help to create better predictions.
